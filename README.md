# Adventures In Algorithms
Welcome! This repository is the **central hub** for my course, **Adventures in Algorithms**. Below is a collection of original, college-level problem sets I designed for my students. Each is designed to require a particular algorithm -- thus inspiring the need to learn about it. I ask my students to tackle these problem sets on their own at first, without the theory, to practice their authentic problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. Then, after a first attempt, I teach them the theory behind an efficient solution -- the algorithm that solves these problems most effectively and efficiently. By working through these problem sets, I hope my students gain knowledge of various algorithms as well as further hone their thinking as puzzlers and programmers.
